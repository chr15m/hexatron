Hello! I'll document progress here as and when this game comes together.

Achievements unlocked:

 * Set up HTML5 + three.js container with ClojureScript and rot.js.
 * Basic map generation and display.

This is my second time using [Clojure and ClojureScript](http://clojure.org/) and I must say it is a dream! Such expressive power in so few characters. The paredit and related plugins transform Vim into a very different and more erudite beast.

This is also my first time using [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) which is magical. Everything you need to build a Rogue-like in one concise package.

The rendering library, [three.js](http://threejs.org/) I have used a bit before. Interfacing it with ClojureScript has been smooth as a platonic spheroid so far.

So that's my toolset. Time to create. I'm excited!
